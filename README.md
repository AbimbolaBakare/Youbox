# YOUBOX

# DEMO - https://you-box.web.app/

## To run the project

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install` 

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Replace the firebase configurations with your own app configurations. The firebase file is located in the src folder: src/service/firebase/firebase.js

In this app, you can see and watch other users video uploads, share the link, like the video and also comment.

You can also upload a video yourself, but you have to be logged in, which is done with the firebase sign in with pop up(Google). The maximum file upload size allowed is 10MB, because of my clouidnary plan and the only file type allowed is mp4
